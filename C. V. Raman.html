    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>
        Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS ( 7 November 1888 to 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.
        <br><br>
Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the age of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a master's degree. He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to carry out independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.
<br><br>
In 1917, he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee at the Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the time, namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926. He moved to Bangalore in 1933 to become the first Indian director of the Indian Institute of Science. He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. He established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to his last days.
<br><br>
The Raman effect was discovered on 28 February 1928. The day is celebrated annually by the Government of India as the National Science Day. In 1954, the Government of India honoured him with the first Bharat Ratna, its highest civilian award.

<u id="highlight">3.    Optics and Light Scattering:</u> <br>Raman's research extended to the broader field of optics and the scattering of light. His studies contributed to our understanding of how light interacts with matter, including the scattering of photons by molecules. His work had implications not only for fundamental physics but also for the development of optical instruments and technologies.
<br><br>
<u id="highlight">4.    Discovery of New Phenomena:</u><br>Raman's work went beyond the Raman Effect. He made important contributions to the understanding of other optical phenomena, such as the "Raman-Nath Diffraction" and the "Raman Lines." These discoveries added to our knowledge of light-matter interactions.
<br><br>
<u id="highlight">5.    Crystal Optics:</u><br> Raman's expertise in optics extended to the study of crystal optics, where he made notable contributions. He investigated the polarization of light as it passed through anisotropic crystals, further advancing our understanding of the behavior of light in crystal structures.
<br><br>
<u id="highlight">6.    Scientific Leadership:</u> Raman's leadership as the Director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and his advocacy for scientific research in India played a pivotal role in fostering scientific talent and research infrastructure in the country. His influence on the scientific community extended beyond his own research.<br><br>

<u id="highlight">7.

    <h2>DEATH</h2>
    <p>
        C. V. Raman, the renowned Indian physicist, passed away on November 21, 1970, in Bangalore, India. His death marked the end of a prolific and influential scientific career. Throughout his lifetime, Raman made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of optics and spectroscopy, and his work continues to inspire scientists and researchers worldwide. His legacy lives on through his groundbreaking discoveries and his enduring impact on the scientific community in India and beyond.
        <br><br>
        At the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory. He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive another four hours. He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers.
        <br><br>
Two days before Raman died, he told one of his former students, "Do not allow the journals of the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of science being done in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not."That evening, Raman met with the Board of Management of his institute in his bedroom and discussed with them the fate of the institute's management.He also willed his wife to perform a simple cremation without any rituals upon his death. He died from natural causes early the next morning on 21 November 1970 at the age of 82.
<br><br>
On the news of Raman's death, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi publicly announced, saying,
The country, the House [of Parliament], and everyone of us will mourn the death of Dr. C. V. Raman. He was the greatest scientist of modern India and one of the greatest intellects our country has produced in its long history. His mind was like the diamond, which he studied and explained. His life's work consisted in throwing light upon the nature of lights, and the world honoured him in many ways for the new knowledge which he won for science.
